  <p>Welcome to Troneline. In this game both players control their own pythons. The objective of this game is to kill the other player by having them ram into your body while avoiding your opponents attempts to kill you. Player 1 can use "S" to pivot off of points and Player 2 can use "K" to do the same.</p>
